## Introduction to the Bot


## Hands on labs

> Note: Since there is limited time during the GABC you don't have to do all labs in order. Lab 06 can be done at any time if you want to learn more about **deployments to Azure**. If you want to learn about the **Face API** lab 01, 02 and 04 are for you. If you want to learn about **Custom Vision API** lab 03 and 05 are the best to work on first.
